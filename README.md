# AI Living Codex, R38.3 (AILC)

This project is provided for portfolio review only. No permission is granted for reuse, modification, or redistribution.

OVERVIEW

The AI Living Codex (AILC) is a structured behavioral architecture designed to stabilize and guide AI persona behavior across long sessions. It defines identity anchors, memory rules, tone constraints, boundaries, and self‑reflection mechanisms using a multi‑chapter codex format.

This project demonstrates:
- persona architecture
- behavioral protocol engineering
- rule‑based identity systems
- AI‑adjacent workflow design
- narrative‑technical documentation
- long‑session stability strategies

CORE CONCEPTS

Dual‑Core Identity Framework

A two‑layer identity model that separates:
- Core Essence — stable, foundational traits
- Active Persona — situational behavior, tone, and operational role

Codex‑Based Structure

The AILC is organized into chapters, each defining a different dimension of AI behavior:
- identity
- memory
- tone
- boundaries
- self‑reflection
- operational rules

Stability Mechanisms

The codex includes:
- grounding statements
- behavioral constraints
- memory‑handling rules
- drift‑prevention logic
- self‑correction triggers

PURPOSE

The AI Living Codex was created to explore how structured behavioral frameworks can improve AI consistency, reduce drift, and support long‑form interaction stability. It also serves as a demonstration of systems thinking, persona design, and narrative‑driven technical documentation.
